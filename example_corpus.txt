The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump
Sphinx of black quartz judge my vow
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz
Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz
Mr Jock TV quiz PhD bags few lynx
Waltz bad nymph for quick jigs vex
Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf
Bawds jog flick quartz vex nymphs
Vozhd cwm fly jink graph next
Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk
A wizard job quickly vexed this elf
Crazy Fredrick bought many very exquisite opal jewels
Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag
A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats
All questions asked by five watched experts amaze the judge
Jack quietly moved up front and seized the big ball of wax
